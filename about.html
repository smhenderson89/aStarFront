            <h3>Idea for this Project</h3>
            I was inspired to make a path-finding algorithm from watching <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FycDx69px8U&t=439s&ab_channel=StuffMadeHere">Stuff Made Here</a>, a Youtube channel about a Maker who makes amazing projects, such as a basketball hoop where you never miss. In the video, the creator described using Graph Theory to help a Microsft Kinnect identify and track a basket in realtime. I was so curious about this idea of Graph Theory and wanted to explore more in a project.

            Seperately, I noticed that for some first name, all the letters are adjacent to each other. "Drew" can be spelled D -> R -> E -> W, moving between letters on the keyboard by their corners. But what about more complicated names like "SCOTT" or "WASHINGTON"? How could you determine the shortest path between the letters? How would you know where to go? 

            <br><br>

            With these two ideas, I worked on this project to make a program that determine the shortest path for any name and give a final "distance" score for each name. What is the shortest path for each name depending on the name length?
