<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Inspiration

![Alt text for basketball hoop gif](https://github.com/smhenderson89/adjacentLetters/blob/main/robotic_basketball_hoop.gif)

I was inspired from watching Stuff Made Here, a Youtube channel about a Maker who makes amazing projects, like a basketball hoop where you never miss (link multiple videos), or a robot that will cut your hair (videos)

In one video, (Name of person) was explaining how used a Kinect in combination with Graph Theory to track a ball midflight to determine where it would land and adjust the hoop to make a shot. I was curious to learn more about Graph Theory and thought it would be great idea for a project.

Seperately, one day workign at Starbucks, I noticed that some customers' name, the letters are adjacent to each other on a QWERTY keyboard. "DREW" can be spelled "D" -> "R" -> "E" -> "W", moving between letters by their corners. But what about more complicated names like "SCOTT" or "WASHINGTON"? How could you determine the shortest path between the letters? How would you know where to go?

With these two ideas, I worked on this project to make a program that determine the shortest path for any name and give a final "distance" score for each name. What is the shortest path for each name depending on the name length?

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] **Stretch Goal:** Adjust for DEVORAK, and some other common keyboard (see [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Character_keys))
- [ ] **Stretch Goal:** Account for other languages accented letters (Renée, Götz, etc. )

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mwoolf87/media-watchlist/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
